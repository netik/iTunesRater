iTunesRater
===========

Cocoa+Applescript dialogbox to quickly go through your catalog and rate it. Great for use with things like the SXSW Torrent (www.sxswtorrent.com)

What this code does is the following:

* You play your iTunes catalog
* Fire up the software
* You click a box to rate something to 0,1,2, or 3 stars. It will also set the song's genre. 

All of this is done by having Cocoa call Applescript to talk to iTunes. 

Setting a song to 0 stars will also set the song to be 'disabled' (unchcked) in the iTunes dialog.

I use this to go through the SXSW torrent. Use at your own risk.

Thanks to jwz for the Applescripts.

Tested with iTunes 11.0.2 and Mac os 10.8.2
